# Eye Disease Detection System

## **Overview**

This project develops an advanced **AI-powered system** for **medical image analysis**, focusing on the **early detection** of **eye diseases**. The system leverages deep learning algorithms to enable accurate diagnosis, automated image interpretation, and clinical decision support. It is scalable and can be deployed in diverse healthcare settings, fostering collaboration, regulatory compliance, and knowledge sharing for improved patient care.

### **Key Features**
- **Eye Disease Detection**: Detects various eye diseases such as cataract, glaucoma, retinal neuropathy, and normal conditions.
- **Early Diagnosis**: Facilitates early diagnosis through automated image analysis.
- **Automated Image Interpretation**: AI algorithms interpret medical images and provide analysis results.
- **Quantitative Analysis**: Generates quantitative insights for better clinical decision-making.
- **Clinical Decision Support**: Assists healthcare professionals with decision-making.
- **Scalability**: The system is designed to be scalable across various healthcare settings.
- **Collaboration & Compliance**: Ensures regulatory compliance and promotes knowledge sharing.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Deep Learning Frameworks**: 
  - **TensorFlow** or **PyTorch** for model training and deployment.
- **Python**: The primary language for implementing the system.
- **OpenCV**: For image preprocessing.
- **NumPy** and **Pandas**: For numerical and data handling.
- **scikit-learn**: For model evaluation and additional machine learning tasks.
- **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**: For visualizations.

## **Dataset**
The project uses an **eye disease classification dataset** with four categories:
- **Cataract**
- **Glaucoma**
- **Retinal Neuropathy**
- **Normal**

Each category contains 1000+ labeled images. The dataset is used to train and evaluate the model on eye disease detection.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Clone the Repository**
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/eye-disease-detection.git
cd eye-disease-detection
```

### **2. Create and Activate Conda Environment**
Create a Conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
```

Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate eye-disease-env
```

### **3. Install Required Dependencies**
In case you don't have a `requirements.txt` file, install the necessary dependencies manually by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Make sure you have the required dependencies to run the model training and testing scripts.

---

## **Usage Instructions**

### **Training the Model**
To train the model, run the following command:

```bash
python train.py
```

This script will:
- Load the dataset.
- Preprocess the images.
- Train the model using a **ResNet architecture** (or any chosen model).
- Save the best performing model weights.

### **Testing the Model**

To evaluate the model on test data, use the `test.py` script:

```bash
python test.py --image path/to/test_image.jpg
```

This will output the model's prediction for the given test image.

### **Model Inference**

After training the model, you can run inference on new images:

```bash
python predict.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

This script will display the modelâ€™s predicted label for the provided image.

---

## **Evaluation Metrics**

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:
- **Accuracy**: Overall accuracy of predictions.
- **Precision**: Measure of how many selected items are relevant.
- **Recall**: Measure of how many relevant items are selected.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.

## **Screenshots**

### **Model Prediction Example**

Below is an example of how the model performs when detecting eye diseases from medical images.

**Before Prediction (Image Input):**

![Test Image](images/test_image.jpg)

**After Prediction (Model Output):**

![Prediction Output](images/prediction_result.jpg)

The model predicts that the image shows a **cataract**.

## **Future Work**

- **Real-time Disease Detection**: Expand the system to detect diseases in real-time, integrated with healthcare devices.
- **Advanced Algorithms**: Improve model accuracy with more complex architectures or additional training data.
- **Web Interface**: Develop a web-based interface to allow healthcare professionals to interact with the system.
- **Cloud Integration**: Build scalable cloud-based solutions for large-scale deployments in healthcare settings.
